# Parler-TTS Mini v1

**Parler-TTS Mini v1** is a lightweight text-to-speech (TTS) model, trained on 45K hours of audio data, that can generate high-quality, natural sounding speech with features that can be controlled using a simple text prompt (e.g. gender, background noise, speaking rate, pitch and reverberation).

With [Parler-TTS Large v1](https://huggingface.co/parler-tts/parler-tts-large-v1), this is the second set of models published as part of the [Parler-TTS](https://github.com/huggingface/parler-tts) project, which aims to provide the community with TTS training resources and dataset pre-processing code.
